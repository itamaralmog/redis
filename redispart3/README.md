Headers and Constants:

k_max_msg: Maximum message size that can be sent or received.
Standard headers included for necessary functions and types.
Utility Functions:

msg: Prints a message to stderr.
die: Prints an error message and aborts the program.
read_full: Reads exactly n bytes from a file descriptor into a buffer.
write_all: Writes exactly n bytes from a buffer to a file descriptor.
Request and Response Handling:

send_req: Sends a request to the server. It first sends the length of the message (4 bytes) and then the message itself.
read_res: Reads a response from the server. It first reads the length of the message (4 bytes) and then the message itself.
main Function:

Creates a TCP socket.
Defines the server address as 127.0.0.1 on port 1234.
Connects to the server.
Sends three messages to the server and reads three responses.
Closes the socket.

server:
The provided code is a simple TCP server implemented in C++ that handles multiple client connections concurrently using non-blocking I/O and the poll function. Below is an explanation of the key parts of the code:

Header Includes
Standard Libraries: Includes common libraries for utilities, memory manipulation, I/O functions, error handling, file control, and POSIX API.
Networking Libraries: Includes libraries for internet operations, socket definitions, and IP address structures.
C++ Standard Library: Includes the vector header for dynamic arrays.
Utility Functions
msg: Prints a message to stderr.
die: Prints an error message along with the error number and aborts the program.
fd_set_nb: Sets a file descriptor to non-blocking mode using fcntl.
Constants and Enums
k_max_msg: Defines the maximum message size as 4096 bytes.
Connection States: Enumerates the states a connection can be in (STATE_REQ, STATE_RES, STATE_END).
Conn Structure
Represents a connection and stores:

File descriptor (fd)
Connection state (state)
Read and write buffers (rbuf and wbuf) and their sizes (rbuf_size, wbuf_size, wbuf_sent).
Connection Management Functions
conn_put: Adds a connection to the vector, resizing if necessary.
accept_new_conn: Accepts a new connection, sets it to non-blocking mode, and stores it in the vector.
Request Handling Functions
try_one_request: Processes a single request from the read buffer, echoes the request back to the client, and switches the state to STATE_RES.
try_fill_buffer: Reads data from the connection into the read buffer and processes requests.
state_req: Handles the request state by filling the buffer and processing requests.
Response Handling Functions
try_flush_buffer: Writes data from the write buffer to the connection and switches the state back to STATE_REQ if all data is sent.
state_res: Handles the response state by flushing the buffer.
Main Event Loop
The main function sets up the server and handles client connections:

Socket Creation: Creates a TCP socket.
Socket Options: Sets the socket to allow reuse of local addresses.
Binding: Binds the socket to the address 0.0.0.0 on port 1234.
Listening: Listens for incoming connections with a maximum queue length of SOMAXCONN.
Non-blocking Mode: Sets the listening socket to non-blocking mode.
Event Loop:
Polling: Uses poll to monitor multiple file descriptors for events.
Accept New Connections: Accepts new connections if the listening socket is active.
Process Active Connections: Processes I/O for active connections and closes connections marked for deletion.
